## About
Developed a C++ application that allows users to add, view, and process a priority queue using a linked list data structure based on the severity score of the patient. Implemented functionality to load and save the priority queue data to a CSV file, ensuring data persistence and easy management. The project demonstrates strong skills in data structures, file handling, and C++ programming.
